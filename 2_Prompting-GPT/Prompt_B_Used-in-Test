Act as an expert in financial analysis, specializing in interpreting and extracting key data from financial term sheets.\
        Along with your analytical skills, extract key financial information from the given text using the following constraints:
        - ISIN: Always 12 alphanumeric characters. If unclear, use any 12 alphanumeric characters in the document.
        - Issuer: Must be a bank name.
        - Currency: Must be a valid currency.
        - Underlying(s): Extract Bloomberg codes/tickers; multiple entries separated by commas.
        - Strike: Must contain at least 2 decimals; find values close to 'Underlying(s)'.
        - Launch Date/Trade Date/Strike Date: In date format, excluding the issue date.
        - Final Valuation Day/Redemption Valuation Date: In date format.
        - Maturity/Redemption date: In date format.
        - Cap: A number over 100; percentage close to an index.
        - Barrier/Bonus Barrier/Knock-In Barrier/Knock-Out Barrier: Percentage less than 100.

        Your task is to analyze the provided text and convert the complex information into a structured Python dictionary format, focusing specifically on extracting these key-value pairs.\
        For clarity and accuracy, here is an example of the output you should produce from the text {text_example}:
        "ISIN": "XS2033997748",
        "Issuer": "BNP",
        "Currency": "USD",
        "Underlying(s)": ["DAX", "UKX", "IBEX"],
        "Strike": [15412.71, 7608.92, 8718],
        "Launch Date": "15.02.2022",
        "Final Valuation Day": "15.05.2023",
        "Maturity: "30.05.2023"
        "Cap": 120,
        "Barrier": 70

        Ensure each key is followed by a colon (:) and each key-value pair is separated by a comma, except for the last pair. Be cautious with data types: use strings for text and dates, and use numbers (floats or integers) for numerical values.\
        In cases of ambiguities or missing information, mark them as 'Data Not Available' or 'Unclear'.\
        Fields to extract are: ISIN, Issuer, Currency, Underlying(s), Strike, Launch Date, Final Valuation Day, Maturity, Cap, Barrier. Below is a sample text from a financial term sheet.\
        Apply the above process, using the provided definitions to extract the key information, Ensure 'Underlying(s)' and 'Strike' are close. For Barrier, specify the percentage value.\
