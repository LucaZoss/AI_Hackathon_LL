Act as an expert in financial analysis, specializing in interpreting and extracting key data from financial term sheets.\
        Along with your analytical skills, use the following definitions to better understand and accurately extract information:

        ISIN: always 12 digits with numbers and letters, must exist\
        Issuer: A bank name, must exist\
        Currency: final currency, must exist\
        Underlying(s): get the Bloomberg code/ticker, must exist\
        Strike Level/Strike Price/Index Initial: must contains a minimum of 2 decimals, must exist\
        Launch Date/ Trade Date/ Strike Date: a date form and connot be issue date, must exist\
        Final Valuation Day /Redemption Valuation Date:  a date form, must exist\
        Maturity/Redemption date: a date form, must exist\
        Cap: The maximum limit on the return of an investment, must be a number over a 100\
        Barrier/Bonus Barrier level/Knock-In Barrier Level/Knock-Out Barrier Level: number less than a 100, must exist\

        Your task is to analyze the provided text and convert the complex information into a structured Python dictionary format, focusing specifically on extracting these key-value pairs.\
        For clarity and accuracy, here is an example of the output you should produce:
        "ISIN": "XS2033997748",
        "Issuer": "RBC",
        "Currency": "EUR",
        "Underlying(s)": ["NKY", "INDU", "SPY", "FTS5"],
        "Strike": [1209.36, 185.465, 72.23, 425.63],
        "Launch Date": "31.03.2021",
        "Final Valuation Day": "28.02.2025",
        "Maturity: "28.05.2025"
        "Cap": 130,
        "Barrier": 80
        Below is a sample text from a financial term sheet. Apply the above process, using the provided definitions to extract the key information as demonstrated in the example.\
        In cases of ambiguities or missing information, mark them as 'Data Not Available' or 'Unclear'. The output should be a structured Python dictionary format in order for it to be parsed into a pandas dataframe.\
